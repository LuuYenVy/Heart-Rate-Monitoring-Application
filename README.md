# HeartGuard - Heart Rate Monitoring & Prediction App

## 📌 Overview

**HeartGuard** is a mobile application designed to monitor heart rate data and predict potential heart disease risks using machine learning models.

The app helps users track their health, detect abnormalities early, and manage medical appointments efficiently.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### 📱 Mobile

* Android (Java)
* MVVM Architecture
* ViewModel + LiveData

### 🔥 Backend & Cloud

* Firebase Realtime Database
* Firebase Authentication

### 🤖 AI / Backend API

* Python (FastAPI)
* RESTful API
* OpenAI API (AI chatbot for personalized health advice)

### 🧰 Tools

* Android Studio
* Postman
* Git & GitHub

---

## 🏗 Architecture

The application is built using **MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel)** combined with the **Repository pattern**.

### 🔄 Data Flow

User Interaction (UI)
→ ViewModel (handles UI logic & state)
→ Repository (single source of truth)
→ Data Sources:

* Firebase Realtime Database (user data, appointments)
* FastAPI Backend (ML prediction API)

### 🧩 Components

* **View (Activity/Fragment)**
  Handles UI rendering and user interactions

* **ViewModel**
  Manages UI-related data using LiveData and survives configuration changes

* **Repository**
  Abstracts data sources and provides clean API for ViewModel

* **Data Sources**

  * Firebase: stores user data in real-time
  * Backend API: processes heart rate data and returns prediction results

### 📌 Key Benefits

* Separation of concerns
* Easier testing and maintenance
* Scalable architecture for future features
